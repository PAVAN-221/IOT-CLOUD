## In short
- **The three large hyperscalers collectively hold ~80% of the global IoT public cloud market.**
- **IoT is of high strategic importance to both Microsoft and AWS, while Google does not prioritize it as much.**

## Why it matters
- **Hyperscalers offer a large number of services in the public cloud that form the backbone of many IoT initiatives.**

The three leading global hyperscalers (**AWS, Microsoft**, and **Google Cloud**) hold more than 80% market share for global public cloud services specifically for IoT workloads according to the latest research from IoT Analytics: <ins>[ Cloud Computing for IoT Market Report 2021–2026](https://iot-analytics.com/product/cloud-computing-for-iot-market-report-2021-2026/)</ins>, a 135-page report on the current state and trends of the IoT cloud computing market.

Although offering public cloud services for connecting IoT devices is not (yet) a major driver for the businesses of these companies, IoT services and related cloud infrastructure investments are expected to grow faster than general public cloud spending and will thus increase in strategic importance during the coming years as public cloud becomes a multi-trillion-dollar market.

AWS had the first-mover advantage, introducing public cloud services in 2006 and adding IoT-specific services in 2015. Microsoft Azure, which launched its public cloud four years after AWS, introduced its IoT services only five months after AWS and has since managed to overtake AWS as the market leader for IoT-specific services thanks to its IoT-centric strategy, a $5 billion investment in IoT in 2018, and its strong business footprint in the enterprise segment, which accounts for some of the biggest IoT deployments. GCP has managed to keep its position as a strong challenger to Azure and AWS due to its stronghold in data and analytics. However, Google’s focus on IoT to this date has not matched that of its major competitors.
